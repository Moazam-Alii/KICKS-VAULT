      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to KICKS-VAULT – Where Authentic Sneakers Meet the Blockchain.
        At KICKS-VAULT, we’re redefining the way sneaker lovers buy, sell, and verify high-value kicks.
        <br><br>

        <span class="green-heading">What We Do</span>
        KICKS-VAULT is a blockchain-based sneaker marketplace powered by smart contracts and AI-driven verification.
        We combine advanced image recognition and Solana NFTs to ensure every pair listed on our platform is 100% authentic and traceable — from the seller to the buyer.
        <br><br>

        <span class="green-heading">Sneaker Authentication, Reinvented</span>
        Every sneaker uploaded undergoes multi-angle AI image verification and is matched with reference data using powerful deep learning models. If it passes, it's minted as an NFT — a digital certificate of authenticity — directly on the Solana blockchain.
        <br><br>

        <span class="green-heading"> Why Choose KICKS-VAULT?</span>
        Authenticity First. NFT Ownership. Transparent. Community-Driven. Built for sneakerheads, by sneakerheads.
        <br><br>

        Mint it. Vault it. Flex it. Only at KICKS-VAULT.
